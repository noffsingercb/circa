// holding date_start ('begins'), the one holding date_end ('ends'), or the
// earliest overlapping segment when the span was already running ('ongoing').
// It never decided WHAT DATE that occurrence renders at, so every occurrence
// inherited date_start and the 'ends' card landed decades early:
//
//   Cold War -- ends, 12 Mar 1947          (should be 1991)
//   Seven Years' War -- ends, 1756         (should be 1763)
//   Great Depression -- ongoing, 24 Oct 1929, printed ABOVE the 1935 BORN card
//
// The resolved date below is what the entry renders and sorts at. date_start
// and date_end are still reported unchanged on the entry, so nothing that
// reasons about the underlying span loses information.

// titled "Industrial Revolution begins" drawn as 'ends' should say neither
// "-- ends" (contradiction) nor lose the title's own verb.
